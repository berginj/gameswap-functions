# GameSwap API Contract

This document is the single source of truth for UI↔API integration. It must be kept identical in both repos:
- UI repo: /docs/contract.md
- API repo: /docs/contract.md

## Cross-cutting rules

### Auth
- All calls assume the user is authenticated via Azure Static Web Apps EasyAuth.
- The API may return 401 when the user is not signed in.

### League scoping (non-negotiable)
- Every league-scoped endpoint requires header: x-league-id: <leagueId>
- Backend validates header presence and authorization (membership or global admin where specified).
- UI persists the selected league id and attaches it on every league-scoped request.

### Roles (locked)
League role strings:
- LeagueAdmin: can manage league setup (fields, divisions/templates, teams), update league contact, and perform all scheduler actions. Second only to global admin.
- Coach: can be approved before a team is assigned. A LeagueAdmin can assign (or change) the coach's team later. Coaches can offer slots, request swaps, and approve/deny slot requests. Some actions (like requesting a swap) may require a team assignment.
- Viewer: read-only. Can view available games/slots and upcoming schedule views. Cannot offer, request, approve, or manage setup.

Global admin:
- isGlobalAdmin is returned by /me. Global admins can create leagues and can perform any league-scoped admin action.

### Standard response envelope (non-negotiable)
All endpoints return JSON with one of:
- Success: { "data": ... }
- Failure: { "error": { "code": string, "message": string, "details"?: any } }

### Error codes (recommended)
- BAD_REQUEST (400)
- UNAUTHENTICATED (401)
- FORBIDDEN (403)
- NOT_FOUND (404)
- CONFLICT (409)
- INTERNAL (500)


### Time conventions (locked)
All schedule times are interpreted as **US/Eastern (America/New_York)**. The API stores and returns:
- `gameDate` / `eventDate` as `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `startTime` / `endTime` as `HH:MM` (24-hour)
The API does **not** convert between time zones.
