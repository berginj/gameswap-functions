# GameSwap API Contract

This document is the single source of truth for UI↔API integration. It must be kept identical in both repos:
- UI repo: /docs/contract.md
- API repo: /docs/contract.md

## Cross-cutting rules

### Auth
- All calls assume the user is authenticated via Azure Static Web Apps EasyAuth.
- The API may return 401 when the user is not signed in.

### Base path
- In Azure Static Web Apps, the API is exposed under `/api`. UI calls should use `/api/<route>` unless a different `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is configured.

### League scoping (non-negotiable)
- Every league-scoped endpoint requires header: x-league-id: <leagueId>
- Backend validates header presence and authorization (membership or global admin where specified).
- UI persists the selected league id and attaches it on every league-scoped request.

### Roles (locked)
League role strings:
- LeagueAdmin: can manage league setup (fields, divisions/templates, teams), update league contact, and perform all scheduler actions. Second only to global admin.
- Coach: can be approved before a team is assigned. A LeagueAdmin can assign (or change) the coach's team later. Coaches can offer slots, request swaps, and approve/deny slot requests. Some actions (like requesting a swap) may require a team assignment.
- Viewer: read-only. Can view available games/slots and upcoming schedule views. Cannot offer, request, approve, or manage setup.

Global admin:
- isGlobalAdmin is returned by /me. Global admins can create leagues and can perform any league-scoped admin action.

### Standard response envelope (non-negotiable)
All endpoints return JSON with one of:
- Success: { "data": ... }
- Failure: { "error": { "code": string, "message": string, "details"?: any } }

### Error codes (recommended)
- BAD_REQUEST (400)
- UNAUTHENTICATED (401)
- FORBIDDEN (403)
- NOT_FOUND (404)
- CONFLICT (409)
- INTERNAL (500)


### Time conventions (locked)
All schedule times are interpreted as **US/Eastern (America/New_York)**. The API stores and returns:
- `gameDate` / `eventDate` as `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `startTime` / `endTime` as `HH:MM` (24-hour)
The API does **not** convert between time zones.

## 1) Onboarding

### GET /me
Returns identity and memberships.

Response
```json
{
  "data": {
    "userId": "<string>",
    "email": "<string>",
    "isGlobalAdmin": false,
    "memberships": [
      { "leagueId": "ARL", "role": "LeagueAdmin" },
      { "leagueId": "ARL", "role": "Coach" },
      { "leagueId": "ARL", "role": "Coach", "team": { "division": "10U", "teamId": "TIGERS" } },
      { "leagueId": "XYZ", "role": "Viewer" }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## 1b) Health

### GET /ping
Health check for the API.

Response
```json
{ "data": { "status": "ok" } }
```

---

## 2) Function call reference (authoritative)

This section is the **artifact for automated reviewers** (including Codex) to understand how every HTTP-triggered
function is called. Keep it current any time a route, method, or authorization requirement changes. The table below
is intentionally minimal: it defines how to call each function and where to find the implementation.

**For Codex reviewers:** treat this section as the canonical API call index. Read the table for routes/methods and
the notes for required headers or roles.

### Maintenance rules
- Every HttpTrigger must appear in the table below with its HTTP method(s) and route.
- If an endpoint becomes league-scoped, call out the `x-league-id` requirement in its notes.
- When refactoring or adding functions, update this table and the matching UI repo copy.

### POST /import/fields (league-scoped)
Requires: LeagueAdmin or global admin.

Import behavior:
- Upserts by `fieldKey`.

## 8) Slots

Slots are **open game offers/requests** placed on the calendar by a coach (or LeagueAdmin). Another coach can see an open slot and **accept** it (via `POST /slots/{division}/{slotId}/requests`). Acceptance immediately confirms the slot (scheduled on the calendar).

Slot status strings
- Open
- Confirmed (accepted + scheduled)
- Cancelled

### POST /import/slots (league-scoped)
Requires: LeagueAdmin or global admin.

Body: raw CSV (`Content-Type: text/csv`)

Required columns:
- `division`
- `offeringTeamId`
- `gameDate` (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `startTime` (HH:MM)
- `endTime` (HH:MM)
- `fieldKey`

Optional columns:
- `notes`

Import behavior:
- Creates slots for the specified league and division.
- `fieldKey` must match an imported field.

### GET /slots (league-scoped)
Query (all optional): division, status, dateFrom (YYYY-MM-DD), dateTo (YYYY-MM-DD)  
Requires: member (Viewer allowed).

Visibility:
- Confirmed slots are visible to all league members (including Viewer).

Default behavior:
- If `status` is omitted, the API returns **Open + Confirmed** slots.
- To see cancelled slots, pass `status=Cancelled`.

Response
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "slotId": "slot_123",
      "leagueId": "ARL",
      "division": "10U",
      "offeringTeamId": "TIGERS",
      "confirmedTeamId": "",
      "gameDate": "2026-04-10",
      "startTime": "18:00",
      "endTime": "20:00",
      "parkName": "Gunston",
      "fieldName": "Turf",
      "displayName": "Gunston > Turf",
      "fieldKey": "gunston/turf",
      "gameType": "Swap",
      "status": "Open",
      "notes": "Open game offer"
    }
  ]
}
```

### POST /slots (league-scoped)
Requires: Coach or LeagueAdmin (not Viewer).

Body
```json
{
  "division": "10U",
  "offeringTeamId": "TIGERS",
  "gameDate": "2026-04-10",
  "startTime": "18:00",
  "endTime": "20:00",
  "fieldKey": "gunston/turf",
  "notes": "Open game offer"
}
```

Rules
- If caller role is `Coach`, the API enforces `offeringTeamId` and `division` must exactly match the coach’s assigned team.
  - If the coach has no team assignment: 400 `COACH_TEAM_REQUIRED`.
  - If team/division do not match: 403 `FORBIDDEN` or 409 `DIVISION_MISMATCH`.
- `gameDate`, `startTime`, and `endTime` are interpreted as US/Eastern and must be valid (`HH:MM`, start < end).
- `fieldKey` must reference an imported field (`parkCode/fieldCode`). The server normalizes `parkName`, `fieldName`, and `displayName` from that record.
- LeagueAdmins (and global admins) may create slots for any team.


### POST /slots/{division}/{slotId}/requests (league-scoped)
Creates a request to take an open slot (this is what the UI calls “Accept”).

Requires: Coach or LeagueAdmin (not Viewer).  
Rules
- Requesting coach must have a team assignment (otherwise 400 `COACH_TEAM_REQUIRED`).
- **Division validation:** requesting coach division must exactly match `{division}`.
- Cannot request your own slot.
- Slot must be `Open`.

Body
```json
{ "notes": "We can play!" }
```

Response
```json
{
  "data": {
    "requestId": "req_123",
    "requestingTeamId": "EAGLES",
    "status": "Approved",
    "requestedUtc": "2026-03-01T12:00:00Z",
    "slotStatus": "Confirmed",
    "confirmedTeamId": "EAGLES"
  }
}
```

### GET /slots/{division}/{slotId}/requests (league-scoped)
Requires: member (Viewer allowed).

### PATCH /slots/{division}/{slotId}/requests/{requestId}/approve (league-scoped)
Legacy/compatibility endpoint.

With immediate-confirmation semantics, slot acceptance already confirms the slot. This endpoint is idempotent:
- If the slot is already confirmed for the given requestId, it returns ok.
- Otherwise it returns 409 conflict.

Requires: member role is not Viewer.  
Rules
- Allowed for: offering coach (offeringTeamId) OR LeagueAdmin OR global admin.
- If the slot is already confirmed for this requestId, returns ok.
- If the slot is confirmed for a different requestId, returns 409.

Response
```json
{ "data": { "ok": true, "slotId": "slot_123", "division": "10U", "requestId": "req_123", "status": "Confirmed" } }
```

### PATCH /slots/{division}/{slotId}/cancel (league-scoped)
Requires: offering team OR accepting team (confirmedTeamId) OR LeagueAdmin OR global admin.
